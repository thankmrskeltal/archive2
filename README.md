# Archive2

`Archive2` is a free, open-source version control system that has been migrated from its original home at instructables.com where it was originally developed by user [PKM](http://www.instructables.com/member/PKM/) under the project [Roll your own version control/automated backup](http://www.instructables.com/id/Roll-your-own-version-controlautomated-backup/step2/Install-your-zip-program/).

This repository aims to provide all necessary source code and documentation in a format that will hopefully reach more of today's developers, and encourage the growth of this project beyond what would be possible from instructables.com alone.

From the author:

> Writing a software project on WIndows? Want access to all your old versions? 
> Don't want to have to say "Oh man, I just lost a week's work" ever again? 
> You need version control and automated backups.

Seeing as PKM did not specify a name for this project, the name `Archive2` was selected based on the central premise of modifying the central `archive.bat` for individual file versioning.

Usage and installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](docs/instructions.md).
